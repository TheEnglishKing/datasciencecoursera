# README: Data Science Coursera | Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is my submission for the course project while completing the Getting and Cleaning course as part of the Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. 

This repository contains an R script for analyzing the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset. The script, `run_analysis.R`, performs the following tasks:

1. **Loading Packages**: The script loads the necessary packages, primarily `dplyr`.

2. **Importing Data**: Data from both the training and testing datasets, including feature data, activity labels, and subject IDs, are imported into R.

3. **Merging Data**: The script merges the training and testing datasets to create a single dataset.

4. **Extracting Means and Standard Deviations**: Only the mean and standard deviation features are extracted from the dataset.

5. **Renaming Columns**: Descriptive names are assigned to the columns in the dataset.

6. **Renaming Activities**: The activities in the dataset are renamed for clarity.

7. **Creating a Tidy Dataset**: A tidy dataset is created by calculating the mean of each feature for each activity and each subject.

8. **Exporting Tidy Dataset**: The tidy dataset is exported to a CSV file named `tidydataset.csv`.

## Usage

To use the `run_analysis.R` script:

1. Ensure that the UCI HAR Dataset is downloaded and extracted into the appropriate directory.

2. Modify the file paths in the script to point to the correct locations of the dataset files on your system.

3. Run the script in an R environment or RStudio.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: The R script for performing the analysis.
- `tidydataset.csv`: The exported tidy dataset.

## Notes

- This script assumes that the required R packages (`dplyr`) are installed. If not, you may need to install them before running the script.

- The script should be run in an environment where the UCI HAR Dataset is available.

For more information about the UCI HAR Dataset, refer to the [original dataset repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).
